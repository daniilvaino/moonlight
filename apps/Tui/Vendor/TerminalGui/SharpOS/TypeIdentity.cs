// Type identity without reflection.
//
// Terminal.Gui asks about types in two very different ways, and only one of
// them actually needs metadata:
//
//   1. "are these the same type?" / "is this exactly a View?" — identity, which
//      is a pointer comparison on the method table and needs nothing else;
//   2. "does this subclass override MouseEvent?" / "is its name ContentView?" —
//      reflection standing in for a fact the type system could have carried.
//
// The first kind lives here. The second was replaced at each site: the name
// check became a marker interface, and the method-override probe became a
// constant (see Responder.IsOverridden), because there is no metadata to search
// and inventing an answer per call would be worse than one stated in one place.
